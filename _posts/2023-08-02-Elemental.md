Finally went to watch this movie! It had been quite long time since last time went to movie theater.
Thanks to Heng for watching the movie with me.

I really like Zootopia and that’s the reason why Elemental is attractive to me. The Elements in the movie are all vivid and adorable! There are some plots make me feel affinity so I want to record it.

(Although I’m preparing GRE and TOEFL recently, I’m going to try to write this essay in English. Good luck for me.)

1. family sacrifice so I need to sacrifice my life
2. fire and water should not be together
3. steal the show is such a love song

but i never once ask what did I wanted to do

I think that’s because it seek down I know it did not matter

because the only way to repay the sacrifice so big it’s by sacrifice your life too
